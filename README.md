# Hospital, population, nursing center data

This repository is a project to present and join datasets pertinent to the COVID-19 pandemic at the county level: hospital location and capacity, nursing home location and capacity, and county-level population estimates by age.

A simplified state-level view of this with only population breakouts for 65+ is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XC0SfpPgYkhLPe4CeXDKs3sgVw8Cbcqa3MpEt8tUQcY/edit#gid=0). The source data for statewide hospital beds is [here](https://www.ahd.com/state_statistics.html).

In general this repo is trying to follow the datakit repo convention, it isn't *actually* a datakit repo but may become one at some point. Source data is in /data/source/ and processed results are in /data/processed/.


# Data


The main output files are described below. In general the output files are in /data/processed/. 

**April 3 update** With help from CMS we've figured out how to get the names of odd-numbered medical units, so the 0X99 lines are now broken out into adult and infped beds. The determination of which beds units are which is visible at a hospital-by-hospital level in [extra_line_units.csv](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/processed/extra_line_units.csv)

### Fast answer: COVID ready ICU beds?

What's a COVID -ready ICU bed? We can't really say. Hospitals are full of creative brilliant folks who are hard at work ramping up capacity to care for patients with COVID. This data is to help understand the health system's prior baseline operations, as reported to CMS. 

One way of thinking about this could be all available emergency beds, roughly arrived at by `subtotal_acute_beds_1400 - acute_beds_0700` Again, we'd caution users not to assume too much, as hospitals have difficult decisions to make, room by room, in regards to separating out COVID patients, and maintaining the capability to treat non-COVID injuries. It may be better to think of a systemwide response rather than focusing too much on any particular hospital. The medical system is complex and shortages of PPE, ventilators, or staff to operate it may all play a larger role than beds. 

Because the lines effected do not directly imply payment, they are possibly more prone to error. If you are concerned with a figure in a particular cost report, consider consulting reports from earlier periods. A file of all reports with extracted data from 2016 through 2019 [is available here](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/processed/cost_report_extracts.csv). 

### Background


The hospital bed counts data come from the raw CMS cost reports database [here](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/Cost-Reports/Cost-Reports-by-Fiscal-Year). They are upwards of ~600MB unzipped, so aren't included in this repo. A simple introduction to how they are structured is [here](https://www.resdac.org/articles/medicare-cost-report-data-structure).

They don't have header rows, if you want to process them you have to add your own. 

For the NMRC file I used 

	RPT_REC_NUM,WKSHT_CD,LINE_NUM,CLMN_NUM,ITM_VAL_NUM
	
For the RPT file I used

	RPT_REC_NUM,PRVDR_CTRL_TYPE_CD,PRVDR_NUM,Unknown,RPT_STUS_CD,FY_BGN_DATE,FY_END_DATE,PROC_DT,INITL_RPT_SW,LAST_RPT_SW,TRNSMTL_NUM,FI_NUM,ADR_VNDR_CD,FI_CREAT_DT,UTIL_CD,NPR_DT,SPEC_IND,FI_RCPT_DT
	
These files have basic hospital information and bed counts from the most recently filed hospital cost report received in 2017 or later. The source report number, fiscal year end date, and filing date is also included. These come from page 9 column 2 of this [original form](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Paper-Based-Manuals-Items/CMS021935) from 2017. 

The documentation is a little hard to follow, see the instructions for completing this form on [p. 62 here](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/source/cost_reports/HOSPITAL2010-DOCUMENTATION/R15P240.pdf).  It refers to [42 CFR 412.105(b) ](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/source/cost_reports/HOSPITAL2010-DOCUMENTATION/CFR-2010-title42-vol2-sec412-105.pdf) which may be relevant. It also cites [69 FR 49093-49098 (August 11, 2004)](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/source/cost_reports/HOSPITAL2010-DOCUMENTATION/FR-2004-08-11.pdf). In general more documentation for the cost reports is [here](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/tree/master/data/source/cost_reports/HOSPITAL2010-DOCUMENTATION).

 
There's an awesome [python notebook](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/analysis/HospitalICUBeds_2017.ipynb) written by [Erin Petenko](https://github.com/epetenko/) that makes a little clearer how to navigate this data.

Each of the hospital bed lines corresponds directly to a line in the column 2 of worksheet S-3 (except for the ICU total). 

A numeric breakdown of the minor lines, which do not end in '00' and are summed in their respective ext\_NN99 variables, are [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAIbiJ7LMPmHVcJvuceMKHTUn__Hly4LYMjeevMO1mc/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Major lines versus subscripted lines

CMS documentation describes major lines in Worksheet 3 part 1; they end in '00'. For instance, ICU beds in theory are given by line '00800'. However, CMS appears to tolerate "subscripted" lines with values other than '00800'. There's no standard as to what these mean; some hospitals might use 801 to mean neonatal intensive care unit beds, whereas others might use it to mean pediatric intensive care unit beds. If you're interested in what each nonstandard unit means, these are listed in the [extra_line_units.csv](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/processed/extra_line_units.csv) with the unit name given in the unit\_name column. There's also a unit\_type column that is our best guess of whether a unit is an Infant/Neonatal bed (listed as "NEO") or a pediatric bed ("PED"). 

To simplify summing beds, we've summed all additional units into 00N99 rows broken out by adult units and pediatric or infant units. In other words, 00800 is listed as icu\_beds\_800 but any other adult units matching 008\d\d will be summed into extra\_beds\_0899\_adult and any infant or pediatric units will be summed into extra\_beds\_0899\_infped. 


### Bed utilization

CMS requires hospitals to report overall bed utilization in the form of days for the same lines as beds. The same format of summation is used: 00800 for icu beds listed as 00800; and 00899 for the sum of 00801, 00802, 00803, etc. 

Bed utilization is given for all\_adult\_icu\_beds and subtotal\_acute\_beds. It's a percentage of days\_in\_period that the beds were full for each reported line. 

Observation bed days are not used in utilization calculations.



### CMS line numbers to column names

Here are the bed numbers used, the variable names appear in **bold**. In general, appended \_XXXX means that the variable appears on line XXXX in the original report, except for XX99 lines, which are summation of "other" values accepted for this bed type.

- **acute_beds\_0700** All Adult/Pediatric Acute Care Beds
- **icu\_beds\_0800** Intensive Care Beds 
- **extra\_0899** All other intensive care beds, including lines '00801','00802','00803','00804','00805','00806','00807','00808','00810','00820','00830','00850'

- **coronary\_beds\_0900** Coronary Care Beds
- **extra\_0999** All other Coronary Care Beds including '00901','00902','00903
- **burn\_beds\_1000** Burn Intensive Care Units
- **extra\_1099** Other Burn Intensive Care Units  including '01001','01002','01003','01004'

- **surg\_icu_beds\_01100** Surgical ICU Beds
- **extra\_1199** Other surgical ICU beds including '01101','01102','01103','01104','01105','01106','01107','01110'

- **oth\_spec\_beds\_1200** Other Specialty Beds
- '**extra\_1299** Other specialty units including '01201', '01202','01203','01204','01205','01206','01210'
 

The sum of the above lines is given by:

- **subtotal\_acute\_beds\_1400** Subtotal of acute care beds 01400

To make working with ICU data easier there's also a column of all 08XX lines:

- **all\_icu\_beds** A summation of **icu\_beds\_0800** and **extra\_0899**. This is used to calculate total ICU utilization. Be skeptical of ICU bed numbers that rely heavily on units described in extra\_0899, often a fraction of these are intended for children or infants and won't be useful for adults. 


Additional hospital bed types (not acute care beds)

- **subprovider\_ipf\_beds\_1600** Subprovider Inpatient Psychiatric beds
- **subprovider\_irf\_beds\_1700**  Subprovider Inpatient Rehabilitation beds
- **subprovider\_oth\_beds\_1800**  Subprovider Inpatitent Other beds
- **skilled\_nursing\_beds\_1900**  Skilled nursing beds
- **nursing\_fac\_beds\_2000**  Nursing Facility beds
- **oth\_longterm\_beds\_2100** Other Longterm beds
- **hospice\_beds\_2400**  Hospice beds

The sum of subtotal\_acute\_beds and all additional hospital bed types is given by

- **all\_beds\_2700** All Beds

- **labor\_delivery\_beds\_3200** Labor and Delivery Beds. These are *not* included in 02700 "All Beds," per CMS rules.


Military hospitals with an id ending in F are missing bed counts but are included here anyways. Many children's hospitals (e.g. hospital_type = childrens) do not report bed counts. Psychiatric hospitals are not included. Recently opened facilities that have not filed CMS reports yet also show zero bed counts.

(The shapefile leaves out [one hospital](https://data.medicare.gov/resource/xubh-q36u/row-hgvv.mh7i-bzfv) in Puerto Rico.)

The hospital's provider number should correspond to the provider number in the next file.

### Bed days

For each of the bed types described above, there is also a corresponding `_bed_days` variable. E.g. icu\_bed\_days\_0800 corresponds to icu\_beds\_0800 and 
extra\_days\_0899 corresponds to the number of beds given in extra\_0899

### Bed utilization

Utilization rate, as a percent, is calculated for all\_icu\_beds and for subtotal\_acute\_beds. To estimate the spare ICU bed capacity, you could use: 	
	`all_icu_beds * all_icu_utilization / 100`

### Employment

The total number of residents/interns and overall payroll employees, taken from line 27, is listed as well. 

### Additional data files


If you are curious as to what the other bed units used by each hospital are, you can look at the [extra line units file](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/processed/extra_line_units.csv). It gives the actual line number used by the hospitals in LINE\_NUM. These line designations do not have a consistent meaning--one hospital may use 801 to refer to pediatric ICU beds while another may use it to refer to neonatal ICU beds.

### Matching non-standard lines to column labels. 

The cost unit number associated with a collection of hospital beds is given in column number 100. Using the example of cost report 648741, which lists nonstandard beds in line 1201, we can determine the cost unit numnber with a query like this

	select "ITM_VAL_NUM" from cost_reports_nmrc where "WKSHT_CD" = 'S300001' and "RPT_REC_NUM" = 648741 and "LINE_NUM" = '01201' and "CLMN_NUM" = '00100' limit 100;

	ITM_VAL_NUM
	-------------
	35.01
	
Converting this value to 03501, we can then look in "worksheet" A00000 with column number '00000' and  plug the unit numnber from before in.


	 select "ITM_VAL_NUM" from cost_reports_nmrc_alpha where "RPT_REC_NUM" = 648741 and "WKSHT_CD" = 'A000000' and "CLMN_NUM" = '00000' and "LINE_NUM" = '03501';
	ITM_VAL_NUM
	------------------------------------
	02080PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT 

Dropping the first five digits, we know these beds are associated with the hospitals "PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT"

## Census data by county by age

Downloadable [csv file](https://github.com/jsfenfen/covid_hospitals_demographics/blob/master/data/processed/2018_county_census.csv) ; [shapefile](https://publicaccountability.s3.amazonaws.com/rawfiles/counties_final.zip)
 
County-level population age data comes from the Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex for the United States, States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018 from the [2018 Population Estimates](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk).

Population estimates are given in 5-year age ranges, e.g. 70-74.
